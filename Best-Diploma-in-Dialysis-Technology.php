                        The Diploma in Dialysis Technology is a two-year paramedical program designed to
                        train students in operating dialysis machines and assisting in the treatment of
                        patients suffering from kidney-related disorders.

                    <p>
                        Dialysis technology plays a vital role in modern healthcare by supporting
                        nephrologists and medical staff during life-saving dialysis procedures.
                        Students gain in-depth knowledge of renal anatomy, dialysis equipment,
                        infection control, and patient monitoring.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The program emphasizes hands-on clinical training in hospitals and dialysis
                        centers, enabling students to develop technical competence and patient-care
                        skills required in real-world healthcare environments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Along with clinical expertise, students also receive career-oriented training
                        through the <b>Power Degree Program</b>, focusing on employability skills,
                        professional development, and placement readiness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Upon completion, graduates are well-prepared to work as Dialysis Technicians
                        in hospitals, multispecialty clinics, dialysis centers, and healthcare
                        organizations, contributing directly to patient care and recovery.
